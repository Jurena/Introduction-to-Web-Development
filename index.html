<p> Welcome to Principled Basics, a site dedicated to helping you find foundational outfits for lazy days or to help you get started and get an understanding of what makes pieces important for an outfit. Disclaimer: this is all based on my own experience, if you don't like what you see, that's okay! This a platform for acceptance of all styles and understanding the subjective nature of fashion. Hope you like what you see, enjoy.
